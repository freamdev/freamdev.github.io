## Development diary

So yea... that didnt really happen, between my exams, my other semester projects and going to classes I didnt had time to run a diary of any sort, much less work on things other then closely related to school. Anyways the game is ready, and I'm uploading it right now.

The whole thing is a bit off from my java and opengl based usual projects, its mostly due to the university constraining me to C and otherwise I am planning to move onto C++ and leave java for the time being, simply cause of the considerably less memory demand from programs that dosn't have to run a framework under the program.

## LoA

The game itself is an old school Ascii Rpg of sort, your character awakens in the middle of nowhere at a strange infinite land, and fight for survival against the cruel weather and the more and more dangerous monsters.

As the player, you can choose from three different game mode, while hunting monsters and trying to gather as many equipment as possible. Enemies you might run into in your journey spawns from orks to golems all the way to the mystical Void Elementals.

Meanwhile your character can be equipped with various wepons and armors looted from the corpses of your enemies.
