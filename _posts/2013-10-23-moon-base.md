# Moon-Base

Moon-Base is a block based RTS game. It was written as my thesis project in school, and was a lot of fun to work on it. The game itself has four different game modes and a map editor included in it. You, as the player have to mine resources, send them back to Earth via cargo ships while surviving in the hostile enviroment of the Moon.
