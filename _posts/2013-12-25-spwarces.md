Hello, and merry christmass everyone!

I used this two days of the holidays to start working on a game called Spwarces, the general idea is not writing a complete 4x space simulator strategy game, but to polish up an old idea I once had back when I was using game-maker and only was learning about programming.

## The game

In Spwarces you controll all four of the players, and what more, you can place down ships, or destroy them any time you want. Thats probabbly feels a bit weird, but as I said, its never intented to be a full game. At any time of course you can let the AI take over for you, but all he does is chasing after the closest enemy ship.

## The reasoning

So why to write a game where you have to do everything, and you can make up the rules as you go. For me this kind of gameplay was always appealing, I could make a story for myself, and watch how it unfolds, without some pesky AI or another player messing with it.

## Specs/Details

Currently the game runs at a solid 60 fps with about 300 ships on the field. I'll probably can make that around 500 by the time I'll upload it to the site. The game field is "infinite" but so is its empty, I'll might include some form of passive background items, but I'm not decided on that.

In the finished version I'm planning to have atleast 15-20 spaceship from small fighters with a single cannon to capital ships armed to teeth.

In the video at the end, you can allready see the two wepon type implemented, these being projectile and beam wepons, also some of the prototype ships, one of them is probably horribly unballanced.

## Plans

Currently my plans for Spwarces is to add a user panel, some more ship, fix any bug I can find then upload it to the site before new years eve. Then keep updating it with one or two ship a week until I get bored with doing that.

On other news, regarding Mistery Dungeon I finnaly finished the monster ballancing, all that left is to clean up the loot table and work on the bugs. If everything goes as I hope I'll be able to release that too soon after my exams end in january.

Until then see you around...
